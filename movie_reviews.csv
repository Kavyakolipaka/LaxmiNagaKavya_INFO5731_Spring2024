Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them. Oh and I forgot to mention it's pretty funny.",firstli adam warlock intro marvel made hate kang depict quantumania even adam seem way hardcor kang shownshown talk high evolutionari deliv reputationnow movi whole love even live emot altern two time blend serv farewel belov band misfit becam famili dont recal ever feel connect charact rocket take spotlight everybodi el great well antagonist protagonistsecond half chaotic love movi gener emot pack great action well last third movi adam warlock felt like wast he portray realli strong charact yet felt like he sidelin whole movi pop disappear deserv better charact arc introduct hope well see thought third act predict though especi mantis role like oh mantiswarlock would conveni scenario moment later hesh pop upi think best qualiti one superhero movi felt invest charact movi focus emot aspect instead plot look cool even though that preval theme movi wasnt expect enjoy much despit look forward thought itd anoth case superhero burnout sad well made farewel guardian galaxi know oh forgot mention pretti funni
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel. Trust me this is a great film.",lead back start great trilog indic past gotg surpass expect noth short phenomen perform cast truli well written shi away could understood requir sen matur understand rocket back stori alon occas dark incred sad tear instanc film honestli expect jame gunn yet provid absolut beauti piec cinematographi say realli hope futur dive back stori coloni adam warlock final mcu like cameo deliv tradit guardian humor film meant matur audienc marvel trust great film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"".

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos.

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony .

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony .

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony .

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.",unlik hit marvel string hit retrospect focus unusu famili rowdi frequent emot sequel seem much like proper final guardian galaxi vol make point great effect mostli due writerdirector jame gunn move skill competitor dcmarvel gotg vol combin visual excit recogniz charact song silli darker thread explor rocket origin promot anim rightsnevertheless guardian feel like return form front follow doubt marvel invulner due underwhelm creativ well monetarili perform antman wasp quantumania lesser extent black panther sequel give gunn credit bid love farewel barrel blaze even close book seri least temporarili
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have....

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony .

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony .

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short. I never expected to fall in love with this movie, but it got to me in such a visceral way that I'll never forget the experience of seeing it.The best marvel film, ever. 10/10.",im one cri movi often one broke four mere estim spent entir last hour film tear guardian galaxi vol unexpect masterpiec work art absolut broke mefrom soundtrack write charact use flashback movi close perfect get alreadi establish charact manag heartwrench way movi leav bittersweet tast mouth much think manag make hour feel ten time short never expect fall love movi got viscer way ill never forget experi see itth best marvel film ever
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short. I never expected to fall in love with this movie, but it got to me in such a visceral way that I'll never forget the experience of seeing it.The best marvel film, ever. 10/10.",im one cri movi often one broke four mere estim spent entir last hour film tear guardian galaxi vol unexpect masterpiec work art absolut broke mefrom soundtrack write charact use flashback movi close perfect get alreadi establish charact manag heartwrench way movi leav bittersweet tast mouth much think manag make hour feel ten time short never expect fall love movi got viscer way ill never forget experi see itth best marvel film ever
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.",unlik hit marvel string hit retrospect focus unusu famili rowdi frequent emot sequel seem much like proper final guardian galaxi vol make point great effect mostli due writerdirector jame gunn move skill competitor dcmarvel gotg vol combin visual excit recogniz charact song silli darker thread explor rocket origin promot anim rightsnevertheless guardian feel like return form front follow doubt marvel invulner due underwhelm creativ well monetarili perform antman wasp quantumania lesser extent black panther sequel give gunn credit bid love farewel barrel blaze even close book seri least temporarili
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This packed an emotional wallop.It had old favorites and new & equally memorable additions and was powered by an awesome sound track and the exchanges and dialogues full of fresh wit.It had an eclectic group of friends, trying to save one of them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"".

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos.

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony .

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony .

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony .

(I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.",unlik hit marvel string hit retrospect focus unusu famili rowdi frequent emot sequel seem much like proper final guardian galaxi vol make point great effect mostli due writerdirector jame gunn move skill competitor dcmarvel gotg vol combin visual excit recogniz charact song silli darker thread explor rocket origin promot anim rightsnevertheless guardian feel like return form front follow doubt marvel invulner due underwhelm creativ well monetarili perform antman wasp quantumania lesser extent black panther sequel give gunn credit bid love farewel barrel blaze even close book seri least temporarili
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X. Absolutely brutal animal cruelty scenes (for some reason it's easier to cope with villains who only target humans) and it had me balling my eyes out at certain points (poor Rocket and his friends).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have....

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony .

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony .

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short. I never expected to fall in love with this movie, but it got to me in such a visceral way that I'll never forget the experience of seeing it.The best marvel film, ever. 10/10.",im one cri movi often one broke four mere estim spent entir last hour film tear guardian galaxi vol unexpect masterpiec work art absolut broke mefrom soundtrack write charact use flashback movi close perfect get alreadi establish charact manag heartwrench way movi leav bittersweet tast mouth much think manag make hour feel ten time short never expect fall love movi got viscer way ill never forget experi see itth best marvel film ever
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short. I never expected to fall in love with this movie, but it got to me in such a visceral way that I'll never forget the experience of seeing it.The best marvel film, ever. 10/10.",im one cri movi often one broke four mere estim spent entir last hour film tear guardian galaxi vol unexpect masterpiec work art absolut broke mefrom soundtrack write charact use flashback movi close perfect get alreadi establish charact manag heartwrench way movi leav bittersweet tast mouth much think manag make hour feel ten time short never expect fall love movi got viscer way ill never forget experi see itth best marvel film ever
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel. Give Gunn credit for bidding a loving farewell with both barrels blazing, even if it does close the books on this series, at least temporarily.",unlik hit marvel string hit retrospect focus unusu famili rowdi frequent emot sequel seem much like proper final guardian galaxi vol make point great effect mostli due writerdirector jame gunn move skill competitor dcmarvel gotg vol combin visual excit recogniz charact song silli darker thread explor rocket origin promot anim rightsnevertheless guardian feel like return form front follow doubt marvel invulner due underwhelm creativ well monetarili perform antman wasp quantumania lesser extent black panther sequel give gunn credit bid love farewel barrel blaze even close book seri least temporarili
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I love Guardians of the Galaxy - a group of misfits who are wholesome, kind, imperfect and therefore wonderful. However this movie is going to give kids the same level of trauma that Never Ending Story, Dumbo, Watership Down, Bambi, etc etc gave Gen X.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor. A lot of the time it was good or passable, but other times it undercut really emotional scenes.I could say a lot more, but this review is already very long.9/10 for me.",guardian galaxi volum chaotic weird oftentim ridicul also full heart emot great themesi must say best marvel movi sinc endgam that necessarili hard though need surpass way home amaz high moment lazi other marvel desper need hit theyv final got ithighlightseveri member crew got time shine rocket definit one stood though see friend die wail pain grief made bawl high evolutionari mock man heavi stuff proce rip face two friend shot well thu rocket traumat pastim revealedchukwudi iwuji fantast villain certain point downright terrifi realli like line god that took place convinc villainth moment starlord scream agoni rocket live moment reson lost mani peopl close cant stand lose anyon elsegamora get lot charact develop im glad didnt kiss quill end would felt littl cheapdrax manti nebula adam warlock other also got moment well im surpris nobodi die honeston problem movi humor lot time good passabl time undercut realli emot scenesi could say lot review alreadi long
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me. Four is merely an estimate. I spent the entire last hour of the film in and out of tears. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is chaotic, weird and oftentimes ridiculous, but it is also full of heart, emotion and great themes.I must say that it's the best Marvel movie since Endgame. That's not necessarily too hard though. It just needed to surpass No Way Home; which had some amazing high moments, but it was lazy in others. Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and they've finally got it.Highlights:Every member of the crew got their time to shine. Rocket was definitely the one who stood out though. When he sees his friend die, then wail in pain from grief? That made me bawl. And when the High Evolutionary mocks him? Man. Heavy stuff. He proceeds to rip off his face, but the other two of his friends are shot as well. Thus, Rocket's traumatic pastime is revealed.Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. At certain points he was downright terrifying. I really liked this line: ""There is no God, that's why I took his place."" He was a convincing villain.The moment when Star-lord screams in agony for Rocket to live, is the moment that resonated with me the most. He has lost many people close to him and he can't stand to lose anyone else.Gamora 2 gets a lot of character development and I'm glad she didn't kiss Quill at the end. That would have felt a little cheap.Drax, Mantis, Nebula, Adam Warlock and others also got their own moments as well. I'm surprised nobody died to be honest.One of the only problems I had with the movie was the humor.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Having sat through some phase 4 films that failed to inspire... Guardians feels like a breath of fresh air. It's less a run of the mill superhero film and more a out of world space adventure handled with care by James Gunn.At its heart, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 3 is a story about family, loss and technology all of which are prominent in today's zeitgeist. These themes sometimes cause you to forget that you are watching a Marvel movie. The movie's backstory is dark but it helps to hammer home the themes and the villain.The universe is full of characters that are both weird (sometimes very weird) and unique when compared to the rest of the MCU. That's mostly a good thing. Despite the movie being dark at times, there is also a lot of humour which fits especially well with the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise when compared to other Marvel franchises. The action and of course the music was up to level we now expect from Guardians of the Galaxy movies. This is one of the better Post Endgame movies and a fitting end to the trilogy.",sat phase film fail inspir guardian feel like breath fresh air le run mill superhero film world space adventur handl care jame gunnat heart guardian galaxi volum stori famili loss technolog promin today zeitgeist theme sometim caus forget watch marvel movi movi backstori dark help hammer home theme villainth univers full charact weird sometim weird uniqu compar rest mcu that mostli good thing despit movi dark time also lot humour fit especi well guardian galaxi franchis compar marvel franchis action cours music level expect guardian galaxi movi one better post endgam movi fit end trilog
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Up to this point, there has been one trilogy in the MCU that has been excellent from start to finish. It's time to add another one to that list. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like ""filler episodes"" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, ""Guardians 3"" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since ""Avengers: Endgame"". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story. Boasting stellar set pieces, an excellent soundtrack and perfect chemistry between cast members, this is a film that I am eager to re-watch.Best Character: Drax

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""There is no God. That's why I stepped in."" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect thing for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics. That one criticism aside, this is still one of the MCU's best and we can thank them for letting James Gunn do what he had in mind.",god that step admit one best line ever spoken supervillain concis captur whole reason seem like would perfect thing thano say oddli though there real backstori high evolutionari usual marvel villain might much materi quit appropri attent realli scruffi argument lovabl hero guardiansi like time around get well deserv fair share screen time mean sit pretti long movi fine manti nebula particular better charact quill gamora drax good ever choic make rocket extend backstori mainspr plot clever end carri real weight rocket elev tragic substanti figur practic level spiderman that say lotth whole guardian seri owe director jame gunn bigtim shame see move im look forward see hell abl dc set motion group charact realli work rd instal build effect top predecessor go theater knew expect got that big complimentat time done warlock high evolutionari kind odd end disappoint warlock especi kind trivial he capabl becom major charact would follow path set origin comic one critic asid still one mcu best thank let jame gunn mind
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Firstly Adam warlock's intro was marvelous, which made me hate Kang's depiction in Quantumania even more because Adam seems way more hardcore than Kang was shown(shown, not talked about). Same with the high evolutionary, they delivered on their reputation.Now the movie as a whole, I loved even more. It's lively and emotional, alternates between the two and some times blends them. Serving as a farewell to a beloved band of misfits who became family, and I don't recall ever feeling this connected to their characters before. Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie. Adam warlock felt like a waste, he's portrayed as a really strong character yet felt like he's in the sidelines for the whole movie; just popping up here and there then disappears. He deserved a better character arc after his introduction, but hopefully we'll be seeing more of him. I thought the third act was predictable though, especially his and mantis's role in it, like ""oh mantis/warlock would be very convenient for this scenario"" and a few moments later he/she pops up.I think the best quality is that it's one of the few superhero movies I felt invested in the characters in a while. The movie focuses on the emotional aspect of it more instead of the plot and looking cool, even though that's a prevalent theme of the movie. I wasn't expecting it to enjoy it as much despite looking forward to it, thought it'd be another case of superhero burnout. It's sad and well made farewell to the guardians of the galaxy... as we know them.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This. This is what I've wanted. Yeah some of the jokes are a bit too silly and the tone is a bit confusing at times. But the end result for me is probably the most heartfelt emotional reaction from me to a comic book movie since Endgame. It's not a perfect film, I am conflicted with what the did with Adam Warlock. And the main villain is a little hammy. But the personal relationship between the guardians and where they take them is dark, heartbreaking, and also beautiful. This is also the best performance from Chris Pratt probably his entire time playing this character. But the person who steals the show is Rocket. I don't know how but they need to change the rules degree voice acting performances can be nominated for Oscars because it was incredible. This is the most emotionally satisfying experience I've had with the MCU in a very long time. And every critic who is saying that the movie is too schmaltzy or sappy... doesn't understand how much these characters not only mean to people but also James Gunn. This isn't just a final chapter of a story, it's a goodbye to a set of characters and films that changed the landscape of not only the tone and vibe of superhero movies but also changed the fact that weird unknown characters who have strange stories can be highlighted in these films.",ive want yeah joke bit silli tone bit confus time end result probabl heartfelt emot reaction comic book movi sinc endgam perfect film conflict adam warlock main villain littl hammi person relationship guardian take dark heartbreak also beauti also best perform chri pratt probabl entir time play charact person steal show rocket dont know need chang rule degre voic act perform nomin oscar incred emot satisfi experi ive mcu long time everi critic say movi schmaltzi sappi doesnt understand much charact mean peopl also jame gunn isnt final chapter stori goodby set charact film chang landscap tone vibe superhero movi also chang fact weird unknown charact strang stori highlight film
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It all leads back to where we once started off as all great trilogies have indicated from the past. But GOTG surpasses expectations with what is nothing short of phenomenal performances by the cast and truly well written and does not shy away from what could only be understood from what requires a sense of maturity to understand. Rockets back story alone is on occasion dark and incredibly sad it had me in tears at a few instances during the film. Honestly I did not expect this, James Gunn yet again provides an absolutely beautiful piece of cinematography and I have to say I really hope in the future they dive back into the story of the colony . With Adam warlock finally in the MCU it's most likely there will be some cameos. But it does deliver in the traditional guardians humor but this film is meant about more for the mature audience of marvel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"A near perfect end to an incredible Marvel trilogy.Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is one of the best Marvel movies ever produced, and on par if not succeeding the first installment. (I personally didn't think number 2 was good at all)The humour is brilliant, the storyline perfectly paced, each character gets their time on screen, the world building was wonderful, the action fantastic, and the CGI far better than some of the more recent Marvel additions. As always, the music was excellent.This entry focuses heavily on our beloved Rocket, and being the final piece of the Guardians Galaxy trilogy, pulls a lot of character arcs almost full circle.Our bad guy, an actor I'm unfamilar with, was the perfect villain, and from a quick search on imdb he is finally being recognised and is cast in a number of popular TV shows. This is also a tear jerker of a movie, so don't be surprised if you find yourself weeping throughout several points of the film.You won't be dissapointed with this final addition to the Guardians, but you may feel a little sad that it has now come to an end.",near perfect end incred marvel trilogyguardian galaxi one best marvel movi ever produc par succeed first instal person didnt think number good allth humour brilliant storylin perfectli pace charact get time screen world build wonder action fantast cgi far better recent marvel addit alway music excellentthi entri focus heavili belov rocket final piec guardian galaxi trilog pull lot charact arc almost full circleour bad guy actor im unfamilar perfect villain quick search imdb final recognis cast number popular tv show also tear jerker movi dont surpris find weep throughout sever point filmyou wont dissapoint final addit guardian may feel littl sad come end

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an unexpected masterpiece, and a work of art that absolutely broke me.From the soundtrack, to the writing, to the characters, to the use of flashbacks, this movie is about as close to perfection as it gets. Having already established all of the characters, it managed to be heart-wrenching all the way through. This movie leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth, and with so much to think about. It manages to make 2 and 1/2 hours feel ten times as short.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is probably my favourite of the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies. James Gunn toned it down in the comedy department with this one to give us a more complex, intriguing and serious story. The film kept all the charm of the crew in it and still had the unique style that the guardians movies have. Mostly to do with the music, always look forward to music in these movies and the soundtrack was fantastic! Emotional and energetic! I loved it! It managed to give us a really emotional story for Rocket whilst having time for everyone else in the film, it was very well written to do that with so many cast members involved. The Rocket storyline is absolutely tragic, and it was really upsetting to hear and watch, even made me cry. The things they did and hearing him cry and squeal as he was ripped apart was really sad and to have what happened to his friends too was the bit that made me cry, the pain of rocket is really heartbreaking as all he wanted to do was free his friends and live with them. There was a lot of shock in the film as things happened that I wouldn't expect and that was great too. Drax who we have had glimpses of has been fully fleshed out in this one with talking about his daughter again which is a big part of the character and him being told he was made to be a dad. Star Lord got more of his Earth story being told and going back to see his grandpa was really cool. Everyone else was really cool too and more Cosmo was awesome! Adam Warlock was good and I can't wait to see more of him but he was a side character for now. It was quite dark for a marvel film with bloody scenes and even the F word was in there! Really enjoyed a more gritty tone in marvel. It was an emotional journey with our characters for one last time and it was one that was awesome but made me cry. Can't wait to see the new guardians of the galaxy at play as they have really cool characters in that roster. Fantastic movie!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This is a fun and exciting space adventure that's elevated by the great heart and humor of its characters, especially Rocket. Throughout the movie, Rocket's character is at the core of the story, and his journey is one of the most interesting and impactful elements of the film.The film features plenty of action and explosions, but at times it feels like there are too many of them. The plot also has a few flaws, with some of the storylines feeling rushed or underdeveloped. However, these issues are overshadowed by the film's strengths - and surprisingly dark themes.This is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, delivering plenty of entertainment. While the film has a few flaws, it's still a fun and engaging, with Rocket standing out as the heart and soul of the movie.",fun excit space adventur that elev great heart humor charact especi rocket throughout movi rocket charact core stori journey one interest impact element filmth film featur plenti action explos time feel like mani plot also flaw storylin feel rush underdevelop howev issu overshadow film strength surprisingli dark themesthi satisfi conclus trilog deliv plenti entertain film flaw still fun engag rocket stand heart soul movi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The most unlikely hit of Marvel's string of hits, in retrospect, focused on the most unusual of families. With a rowdy and frequently emotional sequel that seems very much like a proper finale, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" makes that point with great effect. This is mostly due to writer-director James Gunn moving his skills to competitor DC.Marvel's ""GOTG Vol. 3"" combines visual excitement, recognizable characters, songs, and silliness with a darker thread that explores Rocket's origins and promotes animal rights.Nevertheless, ""Guardians"" feels like a return to form on both fronts following some doubting about Marvel's invulnerability due to the underwhelming (creatively as well as monetarily) performances for ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" and to a lesser extent the ""Black Panther"" sequel.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"So first of all, everything to do with Rocket in this movie is absolutely incredible and heartfelt. I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.",first everyth rocket movi absolut incred heartfelt id even argu flashback best scene weve seen marvel film date top realli appreci much whole movi push boundari pg rate get first marvel fbomb well pretti gori moment mcu standard clearli seen jame gunn given lot leeway make movi want abl get away lot make callback horror root addit whole guardian team great chemistri togeth alway great abl see interact like way movi dealt gamora return relationship peter quill top love moment movi jokingli hint might get someth star lord nebula oddli enough wish get wouldv great subvers expectationsnow onto stuff like le ill start comedi alreadi begin issu nd movi problem modern marvel movi comedi gotg often felt forc joke drawn long realiz seri known comed mayb joke need place natur instead forc much howev opinion though least appreci werent joke moment suppos seriou furthermor soundtrack le appeal time around might due prefer soft rock entri expand differ music era top marvel project massiv cgi battl end ye moment great battl like onetak corridor sequenc still left switch think someth el bloat action sequenc happen keep engag part howev genuin tension felt sure one guardian dead end tension howev unwarr charact die major disappointmentth lack charact death prevent film feel like final intend one two guardian bit bullet definit way wouldv probabl rais rate rocket wasnt laid film instead kidnap couldv die final battl heaven scene couldv actual end follow lylla thu maxim emot impact addit feel like star lord perish wouldv realli great way end mayb better manner tri save zune also guardian split doesnt feel satisfi classic trope group peopl split realiz happiest togeth opinion lack final setup charact return futur marvel movi lessen suppos impact last time see guardian togeth might get guardian galaxi although wouldnt surpris bet see team togeth aveng anoth project even briefli doesnt feel like epic conclus promis rather setup charact featur mcu go forward guess comic book movi never proper end even someth great like logan prove hugh jackman set return deadpool mayb shouldnt expect film provid conclus studio alway tri get charact actor money made howev overal even though lot review mightv seem neg much enjoy movi didnt wow like seem peopl simpli lack final person desir
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a bit of a tonal mess, and quite easily my least favourite of the three. That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk. That puts it behind the original, which is hard to fault, or Vol. 2, which is a little easier to fault, but those faults don't mean too much when balanced with what works.With Vol. 3, I think it's that imperfect balancing of the comedy, action, sentimentalism, and heartbreak that makes it stumble. The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining. It looks better and is visually more inspired than anything from Phase 4. Maybe that's not saying much, but there is creativity there. And I like how violent, out there, and heavy it can get - I just don't think it combines seamlessly with the fun stuff and the jokes.Still, I feel it's generally a success. Maybe tugs on the heartstrings a little too aggressively, but a lot of it works. I liked how they handled all the characters, besides maybe Gamora and newcomer Adam Warlock. The storyline is otherwise sound, as are the other character arcs, and it's a pretty good end to what's been a nice trilogy.",guardian galaxi vol bit tonal mess quit easili least favourit three said entertain good deal fun watch cant call slam dunk put behind origin hard fault vol littl easier fault fault dont mean much balanc workswith vol think imperfect balanc comedi action sentiment heartbreak make stumbl two movi got balanc right screenwrit miracl could technic feel unwieldi unbalanc doesnt quit mesh togeth ideallyther realli violent scene genuin traumat honestli kind disturb moment joke youd expect theyr larg funni sad scene realli corni scene moment work isol vol bit like best orchestra world led conductor who roll bed take better part two half hour wake upbut individu element let wash work extrem well minut long doesnt feel pace larg work entertain look better visual inspir anyth phase mayb that say much creativ like violent heavi get dont think combin seamlessli fun stuff jokesstil feel gener success mayb tug heartstr littl aggress lot work like handl charact besid mayb gamora newcom adam warlock storylin otherwis sound charact arc pretti good end what nice trilog

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This film was A LOT darker than I ever thought a Marvel comic-book film would, or could be. It was also so much better - and the bar for GOTG was already set high in light of its past installments.Instead of repeating all the positives which other reviewers have already pointed out, I wanted to say that I am a strong proponent for animals and animal welfare and normally steer away from watching films with animal brutality or cruelty in them. In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age? Then again, the fact that the creators of what is normally considered to be ""family fare"", chose to go this deep and cuttingly into the subject, is something which bears recognition, be it whether they meant it for the sake of good, or for recognition's sake itself. Either way, what is depicted, cuts deeply.Even with its flaws - and it DOES have flaws (such as going over the top with all the in-fighting) - this GOTG is, in my opinion, the best of the trilogy ... and yet ... I cannot see myself rewatching it with the frequency which I did the first two installments. You see, for all its worthy action, excellent (although toned-down) humor, its seamless arc and overall brilliance, at its core, it is a difficult watch in parts ... full of heartache and heartbreak.In the end, all that's left to say, at least for this viewer, is: THANK YOU James Gunn, for the creative miracle that is your brain and for the dedication with which you have served the Guardians and all GOTG fans everywhere. Also, I would be remiss not to include a big shout-out to Will Poulter who SO magnificently plays Adam Warlock, that he seamlessly captures and delivers the essence of both hero and villain, and gives us hope in second chances and redemption. More importantly, a big I ""heart"" you to the tremendous actors who portrayed our heroes, and thank you for HOURS and HOURS of laughter, and now tears.",film lot darker ever thought marvel comicbook film would could also much better bar gotg alreadi set high light past installmentsinstead repeat posit review alreadi point want say strong propon anim anim welfar normal steer away watch film anim brutal cruelti case torn cours fiction tale far realiti live mani anim even day age fact creator normal consid famili fare chose go deep cuttingli subject someth bear recognit whether meant sake good recognit sake either way depict cut deeplyeven flaw flaw go top infight gotg opinion best trilog yet see rewatch frequenc first two instal see worthi action excel although toneddown humor seamless arc overal brillianc core difficult watch part full heartach heartbreakin end that left say least viewer thank jame gunn creativ miracl brain dedic serv guardian gotg fan everywher also would remiss includ big shoutout poulter magnific play adam warlock seamlessli captur deliv essenc hero villain give u hope second chanc redempt importantli big heart tremend actor portray hero thank hour hour laughter tear

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is the third and final installment in the popular Marvel franchise, which follows the adventures of a ragtag team of cosmic heroes. It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).""The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.""The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast. It is also a celebration of the themes that have defined the Guardians: family, friendship, redemption, and heroism. It is a movie that will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and dance along with these lovable misfits who have become legends in their own right.",guardian galaxi vol third final instal popular marvel franchis follow adventur ragtag team cosmic hero serv fit farewel one belov distinct franchis marvel cinemat univers writerdirector jame gunn deliv thrill hilari emot conclus trilog guardian face biggest challeng yet save one mad scientist creat himth plot film revolv around guardian quest save rocket cooper reveal genet engin experi high evolutionari iwuji mad scientist want creat perfect societi eugen along way also deal adam warlock poulter power creat ayesha debicki leader sovereign race seek reveng guardian steal batteri film also explor aftermath gamora saldana death resurrect affect relationship peter quill prattth action scene wellchoreograph thrill movi skill balanc action comedi drama maintain focu charact relationship cast deliv excel perform pratt cooper deliv heartfelt portray quill rocket struggl ident purpos saldana karen gillan shine gamora nebula whose complic sisterhood evolv throughout film drax play dave bautista deliv funniest line pom klementieff add sweet charm manti vin diesel sean gunn also great groot kraglin respectivelyth movi also introduc new charact fit well guardian world poulter impress adam warlock conflict arc set futur stori iwuji menac high evolutionari serv formid villain person nemesi rocket maria bakalova steal everi scene she cosmo spacedog telepath soviet canin help guardian sylvest stallon also return stakar ogord lead team ravag includ michael rosenbaum martinex daniela melchior urath movi visual stun vibrant color imagin design bring counterearth cosmic locat life cinematographi henri braham dynam invent captur action emot flair edit fred raskin greg dauria tight smooth keep pace brisk engag music john murphi epic catchi blend orchestr cue classic rock song fit tone mood sceneguardian galaxi vol satisfi end amaz saga entertain move million fan around world testament gunn vision talent well chemistri charisma cast also celebr theme defin guardian famili friendship redempt heroism movi make laugh cri cheer danc along lovabl misfit becom legend right
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"This truly feels like the end of the Golden Age of the MCU. We're saying goodbye to characters we've been with for nearly 10 years. I had faith in James Gunn to pull off a fitting farewell, and that faith was rewarded. Vol. 3 is a heartbreaking, emotional departure for these beloved characters. Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff. I'm honestly impressed that Gunn found a perfect way to close each character's chapter and did so without resorting to cop out deaths.In true Gunn fashion, the production design and worlds are weirder than ever. The visuals and colors are always a highlight of these films. The soundtrack is no different. Awesome Mix Vol. 3 has plenty of bangers, with one Beastie Boys scene as the highlight of the film for sure. I was prepared for an emotional story, but man, I wasn't prepared for all of the feels from the animals. Contrasted with that is the truly terrifying villain. The High Evolutionary is a real standout amongst the long list of MCU villains for being genuinely repulsive, yet simultaneously compelling.Excluding No Way Home, GOTG 3 is my favorite Marvel film since Endgame. It did everything it needed to do and more. I'm hoping this is a sign of things to come for Marvel, and is not solely due to the immense passion and talent of now studio rival James Gunn.",truli feel like end golden age mcu say goodby charact weve nearli year faith jame gunn pull fit farewel faith reward vol heartbreak emot departur belov charact rocket take spotlight threequel everi charact manag get shine receiv suitabl sendoff im honestli impress gunn found perfect way close charact chapter without resort cop deathsin true gunn fashion product design world weirder ever visual color alway highlight film soundtrack differ awesom mix vol plenti banger one beasti boy scene highlight film sure prepar emot stori man wasnt prepar feel anim contrast truli terrifi villain high evolutionari real standout amongst long list mcu villain genuin repuls yet simultan compellingexclud way home gotg favorit marvel film sinc endgam everyth need im hope sign thing come marvel sole due immens passion talent studio rival jame gunn
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Guardians 3 is not what I has hoping for; that isn't to say it's a terrible film or that some people won't love it, but I imagine that it will be somewhat divisive in how audiences take to the new direction this film goes in.First off is it full of the social politics that Disney has become infamous for? Not really, unless you count Disney's continued quest to avoid depicting happy heterosexual relationships. Will you like it? Depends on what you are looking for. If you want something like the first two, ie a comedic film with serious moments, then you'll likely be disappointed, as this is a serious movie with comedic moments.And make no mistakes, this is a serious movie. Not only is it the darkest Guardians movie by far, it's arguably the darkest MCU film to date. Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, ""how can we make this more depressing?"" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.",guardian hope isnt say terribl film peopl wont love imagin somewhat divis audienc take new direct film goe infirst full social polit disney becom infam realli unless count disney continu quest avoid depict happi heterosexu relationship like depend look want someth like first two ie comed film seriou moment youll like disappoint seriou movi comed momentsand make mistak seriou movi darkest guardian movi far arguabl darkest mcu film date rocket backstori especi feel manipul melodrama come danger close miseri porn though gunn crew sat around writer room constantli ask make depress film get grim part seri trademark humor show rather lighten mood instead feel place tonal inconsistentanoth note grim dark natur film even though still rate pg skirt closer r rate mcu film far overli gratuit moment genuin brutal violenc kind surpris first mcu film drop fbomb honestli think lot parent gon na taken aback differ kind film compar twoth pace film either good bad depend person view long stori short fast pace movi kind jj abram break neck pace never let audienc stop mull anyth happen alway move forward yet despit still felt movi minut longer need everi movi need epic length run timemi biggest issu film though end rather satisfi conclus film one kind peeter end real sen closur bizarr given suppos final film og cast crew feel le like seri final like season final everyon set start futur money good enoughso like cast great usual peopl clearli enjoy work charm watch togeth fx amaz better recent mcu film action scene pretti great probabl favorit part high observ unlik mani recent disney project bad guysgal misunderstood antihero villain unmitigatedli evil make feel much threaten mcu baddi recent memoryin end isnt bad movi great one either easili worst guardian film still leagu better phase mcu film except way home love seri mayb check warn differ beast youv like come expect
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"James Gunn is one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice. Watching his ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to ""Creep"" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is most appealing when it defies a ""product over art"" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of ""Vol. 3"" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like ""Creep""; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too. The flashback/mission structure of ""Vol. 3"" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact.",jame gunn one filmmak oper massiv system biggest movi moneymak factori world without sacrif voic watch guardian galaxi vol see director know balanc corpor need person blockbust filmmak scifiactioncomedi still succumb mcu issu late there creativ filmmak dialogu perform modern superhero movi often lack gunn like kid play action figur he pull apart smash back togeth make new creation doesnt love loser want see save univers rocket racoon voic bradley cooper listen creep radiohead tonesett teach special movi fill clever needl drop make tonesett adam warlock poulter rocket chukwudi iwuji attack high evolutionari chukwudi iwuji rocket take worst beat hover near death movi put film two track flashback rocket origin stori presentday tale guardian tri save mission lead high evolutionari mad scientist creat rocket year ago guardian galaxi vol appeal defi product art aesthet clunki weird thrill see gunn push unsettl creatur design set feel like theyr take place actual physic space instead bland cgi make superhero movi look like watch someon el play video game there version vol that even chaotic person everi time blockbust felt like edg content art back flashbackmiss structur guardian galaxi vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact remind best blockbust dont sing along wellknown tune like creep make song gunn would say make u special flashbackmiss structur vol sometim drain film momentum gunn person intact
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"Struggling to find the right word(s) to sum this up... Underwhelmed. Decent. Oversold. Frustrating.Maybe the superhero / MCU fatigue is real, I just didn't love this film as much as I thought I would have.Early screenings and reviewers said this is the ""Best MCU film""... ""10/10"" etc... I feel 7/10 is where this belongs.The Good:
The acting performances were perfect, with great showings from the entire cast. The CGI was great. The character development was fantastic, especially for Drax The Daddy. The score and soundtrack were fantastic.The Bad:
Adam Warlock and The High Evolutionary are two of the most PATHETIC villains in the entire MCU. Adam is just a mummy's boy whose ""strength "" is non-existent, mostly pointless character. He's weak and ultimately joins the new Guardians of the Galaxy. The High Evolutionary is just a spoilt man-child, essentially a weaker Kang with anger issues. I kept thinking throughout, this feels like if Thor Love and Thunder had a baby with Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania. Additionally, James Gunn's humour destroys every tense scene, there's far too much of his humour splattered into every scene.Now the biggest issue I have.... THE PLOT ARMOUR....Groot gets beheaded.... grows his body back and lives.Mantis gets battered but is healed seconds later.Drax gets beaten to the inch of his life yet survives and is fully recovered seconds later.Nebula gets every limb twisted yet repairs herself immediately.All of this is just the opening scene....Nebula gets shot in the back and she's 'bleeding' out but is fine seconds later.Drax gets shot both through the back and the heart.... yet is FINE.Peter Quill launches himself into space unprotected for 50ish seconds... AND IS PERFECTLY FINE IN THE NEXT SCENE.Rocket ""dies"" for a few seconds for dramatic effect yet...you guessed it... comes back to life.Now don't misinterpret this, I LIKED the film, but in no way did I LOVE the film, and the ending left me so dissatisfied.",struggl find right word sum underwhelm decent oversold frustratingmayb superhero mcu fatigu real didnt love film much thought would haveearli screen review said best mcu film etc feel belongsth good act perform perfect great show entir cast cgi great charact develop fantast especi drax daddi score soundtrack fantasticth bad adam warlock high evolutionari two pathet villain entir mcu adam mummi boy whose strength nonexist mostli pointless charact he weak ultim join new guardian galaxi high evolutionari spoilt manchild essenti weaker kang anger issu kept think throughout feel like thor love thunder babi antman wasp quantumania addit jame gunn humour destroy everi ten scene there far much humour splatter everi scenenow biggest issu plot armourgroot get behead grow bodi back livesmanti get batter heal second laterdrax get beaten inch life yet surviv fulli recov second laternebula get everi limb twist yet repair immediatelyal open scenenebula get shot back she bleed fine second laterdrax get shot back heart yet finepet quill launch space unprotect ish second perfectli fine next scenerocket die second dramat effect yetyou guess come back lifenow dont misinterpret like film way love film end left dissatisfi
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"The MCU and Disney as a whole have had a large amount of duds in recent years, with failure after failure for both TV and film, an entire Phase of their Cinematic Universe falling flatter than a pancake with viewers and drops in revenue across all fronts, they need Phase 5 to be a success and the stuttering start it's has isn't in any way a good thing for the future.Spoilers incoming because it's never going to stop hurting.Last time we saw the Guardians was in Love and Thunder and like their portrayal there, there's little development here, the story of finding Gamorah isn't the important part as bad guys and massive multi-movie story plots need to be shoved in and set up for the beginning of this, we've got the High Evolutionary involved in it and we get a continuation of the Sovereign's plot from the last GOTG movie.But not enough for things to be the central plot because like I said, have to stick in the next major bad guy that is going to be a threat across movies...for some reason I can never figure out.There's a lot of cute moments, a lot of furry animal adorableness and pay offs for cameos in previous movies that end up being just there for 'oh I remember that' rather than worthwhile contributions.But the weirdest part is the inclusion of children, again. This is like the 5th Marvel property to forcibly include children in a story for no reason whatsoever, the High Evolutionary didn't need kids at his base, we already had enough reason to dislike him with what happened with Rocket, but include that like they did with Love and Thunder, Multiverse of Madness and Quantumania. I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"It's not bad. It's much more mature than previous Guardians. Unfortunately, more mature doesn't mean better.The best part of Guardians was they were fun. First one was also pretty funny. This one is almost no fun at all and it's certainly not funny.A lot of it has to do with music. Now, sure, 90s music was way worse than 80s (used in previous installments), but, still, I'm pretty sure several good songs could have been found.The girls are not hot, while they used to be. It's strange, 'cause Gillan and Debicki are actually in their prime, but actually Saldana is the least ""cold"" of the three.The only ones trying to have fun are Dex and Mantis, but it just doesn't work, they just get points for effort. Starlord was probably the funniest, yet he's just pinning about Gamora the whole time, which understandably angries her. Gamora is also no fun, she's just angry.Adam Worlock is a buffoon, but not a funny one. The villain, High Evolutionary, while being a little interesting as a more realistic foe, doesn't pose much of a threat and is not fun.Even the Nathan Fillion appearance is not very fun or funny.The story, while more mature, is also underwhelming. A lot of time is wasted in the silly interaction between Rocket and his caged genetic experimented companions. That time could have been used to show just how deep of an impact Rocket's predicament has on the Guardians.The ending is the most underwhelming. There's no substantial reason for the band breaking up, except for Gamora, but this Gamora was not part of the band to begin with. Why does Nebula suddenly decide she wants to be the mayor? It's fine for Starlord to visit his grandpa, but to forego the team he created in order to ""learn to swim""... the metaphor is actually not very clear, which might be fine for a poem, but for a superhero movie?All this leads to the ""most important thing"". Groot finally says something other than ""I am Groot""... and it doesn't work! It's very disappointing and underwhelming.At the end, it says that Starlord will be back. It would be nice for him to come back for one last laugh, as this doesn't really work as a goodbye for him (nor most other Guardians).",bad much matur previou guardian unfortun matur doesnt mean betterth best part guardian fun first one also pretti funni one almost fun certainli funnya lot music sure music way wors use previou instal still im pretti sure sever good song could foundth girl hot use strang caus gillan debicki actual prime actual saldana least cold threeth one tri fun dex manti doesnt work get point effort starlord probabl funniest yet he pin gamora whole time understand angri gamora also fun she angryadam worlock buffoon funni one villain high evolutionari littl interest realist foe doesnt pose much threat funeven nathan fillion appear fun funnyth stori matur also underwhelm lot time wast silli interact rocket cage genet experi companion time could use show deep impact rocket predica guardiansth end underwhelm there substanti reason band break except gamora gamora part band begin nebula suddenli decid want mayor fine starlord visit grandpa forego team creat order learn swim metaphor actual clear might fine poem superhero movieal lead import thing groot final say someth groot doesnt work disappoint underwhelmingat end say starlord back would nice come back one last laugh doesnt realli work goodby guardian
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023) - IMDb,"One word comes to mind: contrivance.This film is one gigantic contrivance. Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.",one word come mind contrivancethi film one gigant contriv plot charact heck everyth commit worst sin film like make boringrememb much fun first guardian movi rememb sweet lovabl charact rememb fresh silli genuin entertain wasthat absent movi overblown overwrought absolut clue want betalk clueadam warlock oh gosh absolut idea like threw he tea previou movi he he excit enjoy remot necessari stori wast everyon timeov last year weve grown love charact bigger meaner facsimil vari degre importantli didnt buy sellingth movi feel like theme park attract cheesi stupid way cant help roll eye there littl heart almost soul movi go motion marvel movi product consum like anyth that made without care purpos leav feel empti insidechri pratt use endear charm comed sensibl peter quill like child play han solo relat gone line land feel unnecessari drop fbomb funni also felt unnecessari immedi afterwardth thing work rocket backstori took favorit charact guardian frame film around let say thing remot work told origin coma major film stori engag bit unsettl thing keep unnecessarili long film even remot worth invest timeth high evolutionari alway intrigu engag villain fall marvel trap becom anoth bad guy purpos evil isnt compel interest give u reason care he he unsympathet poorli deploy there littl threat motiv arent excit say ring true comic counterpart id lean bodi horror concept made dr moreau lame loud obnoxi version didnt engag mei saw bunch marvel fan everyon around stuck around mid postcredit scene throughout film heard mani peopl frustrat laugh dumb movi waswev come expect lot jame gunn he fantast director abil add genuin patho soul mani charact get someth feel half bake overcook time mani charact mani plot contriv happen absolut nowher end day worth time money efforti want leav theater actual want end sooner gone feel year old joy wonder feel exhilarationit gonei tri neg dont want rant thing hate want spread joy happi love mani time found want yell screen insult mine audienc collect intellig good faith previous earn final danc number ye danc number happen felt embarrassedit left think one thing exactli movi dour mean kid engag smart enough appear adultsoh want scream groot end
